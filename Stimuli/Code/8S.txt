The woman had brought two daughters into the house with her, who were
beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart. Now began a bad
time for the poor child. “Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with
us?” said they. “He who wants to eat bread, must earn it. Out with the
kitchen-wench!”

They took her pretty clothes away from her, put an old gray bedgown on her
and gave her wooden shoes. “Just look at the proud Princess, how decked out
she is!” they cried, and laughed, and led her into the kitchen.

There she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up before
daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash. Besides this, the
sisters did her every imaginable injury—they mocked her and emptied her
peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was forced to sit and pick
them out again.

In the evening, when she had worked till she was weary, she had no bed to
go to, but had to sleep by the fireside in the ashes. And as on that
account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her Ash-Maiden.

What did the evil sisters empty into the ashes?
