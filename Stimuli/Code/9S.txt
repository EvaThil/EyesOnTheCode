There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the world but
the house in which he lived. Now each of the sons wished to have the house
after his father’s death; but the father loved them all alike, and did not
know what to do. He did not wish to sell the house, because it had belonged
to his forefathers, else he might have divided the money amongst them.

At last a plan came into his head, and he said to his sons, “Go into the
world, and try each of you to learn a trade. When you all come back, he who
makes the best masterpiece shall have the house.”

The sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be a
blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master. They fixed
a time when they should all come home again, and then each went his way.

What trade did the second son decide to learn?
