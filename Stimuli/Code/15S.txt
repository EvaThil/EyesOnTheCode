“Have you no other daughter?”

“No,” said the man; “there is only a little stunted kitchen-girl which my
late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the Bride.”

The King’s Son said he was to send her up to him; but the mother answered,
“Oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show herself!”

He insisted on it, and Ash-Maiden had to be called. She first washed her
hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the King’s Son,
who gave her the golden shoe.

Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden
shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove.

And when she rose up and the King’s Son looked at her face he recognized
the beautiful maiden who had danced with him, and cried, “That is the true
Bride!”

What was the Ash-Maidens own shoes made out of?
