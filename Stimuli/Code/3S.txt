Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard
the voice of the Witch, she unfastened her braided tresses and wound them
round one of the hooks of the window above. And then the hair fell twenty
ells down, and the Witch climbed up by it.

After a year or two, it came to pass that the King’s Son rode through the
forest and went by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming
that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude
passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.

The King’s Son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the
tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so
deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and
listened to it.

Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that a Witch came
there, and he heard how she cried:
“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down thy hair.”

What did Rapunzel do to get the king's sons attention?
