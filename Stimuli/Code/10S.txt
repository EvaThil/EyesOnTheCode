A certain man had a Donkey, which had carried the corn-sacks to the mill
faithfully for many a long year; but his strength was going, and he was
growing more and more unfit for work.

Then his master began to consider how he might best save his keep; but the
Donkey, seeing that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out on the
road to Bremen.

“There,” he thought, “I can surely be town-musician.”

When he had walked some distance, he found a Hound lying on the road,
gasping like one who had run till he was tired.

“What are you gasping so for, you big fellow?” asked the Donkey.

“Ah,” replied the Hound, “as I am old, and daily grow weaker and no longer
can hunt, my master wants to kill me. So I have taken to flight. But now
how am I to earn my bread?”

“I tell you what,” said the Donkey, “I am going to Bremen, and shall be
town-musician there. Come with me and engage yourself also as a musician. I
will play the lute, and you shall beat the kettledrum.”

The Hound agreed, and on they went.

To what town did the animals set out to become musicians?
