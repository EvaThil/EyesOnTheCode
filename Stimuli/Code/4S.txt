The little sister said, “Oh, I pray you, dear little Brother, do not drink,
or you will become a Roe, and run away from me.”

But the little brother had knelt by the brook, and had bent down and drunk
some of the water. And as soon as the first drops touched his lips, he lay
there a young Roe.

And now the little sister wept over her poor bewitched little brother, and
the little Roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her. But at last the
girl said, “Be quiet, dear little Roe, I will never, never leave you.”

Then she untied her golden garter and put it round the Roe’s neck, and she
plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord. With this she tied the
little animal and led it on; and she walked deeper and deeper into the
forest.

And when they had gone a very long way, they came to a little house. The
girl looked in; and as it was empty, she thought, “We can stay here and
live.”

What did the brother turn into when he drank the water?
