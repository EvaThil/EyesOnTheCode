There was once on a time, an old Goat who had seven little Kids, and loved
them with all the love of a mother for her children.

One day, she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she
called all seven to her and said, “Dear Children, I have to go into the
forest. Be on your guard against the Wolf. If he come in, he will devour
you all—skin, hair, and all. The wretch often disguises himself; but you
will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.”

The Kids said, “Dear Mother, we will take good care of ourselves. You may
go away without any anxiety.”

Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.

It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door, and cried, “Open
the door, dear Children! Your mother is here, and has brought something
back with her for each of you.”

But the little Kids knew that it was the Wolf, by his rough voice. “We will
not open the door,” cried they; “you are not our mother. She has a soft,
pleasant voice, but your voice is rough. You are the Wolf!”

How does the mother describe the wolfs voice?
