One morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest. The sun
shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept through the leaves, and
he was full of joy and gladness. He had as yet met no one, when he suddenly
perceived the old Witch kneeling on the ground cutting grass with a sickle.
She had already thrust a whole load into her cloth, and near it stood two
baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears.

“But, good little Mother,” said he, “how can you carry all that away?”

“I must carry it, dear Sir,” answered she; “rich folk’s children have no
need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the saying goes, ‘Don’t
look behind you, you will only see how crooked your back is!’

“Will you help me?” she said, as he remained standing by her. “You have
still a straight back and young legs, it would be a trifle to you. Besides,
my house is not so very far from here. It stands there on the heath behind
the hill. How soon you would bound up thither!”

The young man took compassion on the Old Woman. “My father is certainly no
peasant,” replied he, “but a rich Count. Nevertheless, that you may see it
is not only peasants who can carry things, I will take your bundle.”

What was the old woman doing on the ground?
