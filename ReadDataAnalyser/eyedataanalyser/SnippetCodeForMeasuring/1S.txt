And as she thus lamented, some one said to her, “What ails you, King’s
Daughter? You weep so that even a stone would show pity.”

She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a Frog
stretching its thick, ugly head from the water. “Ah! old water-splasher, is
it you?” said she; “I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into
the fountain.”

“Be quiet, and do not weep,” answered the Frog, “I can help you. But what
will you give me if I bring your plaything up again?”

“Whatever you will have, dear Frog,” said she—“my clothes, my pearls and
jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.”

The Frog answered, “I do not care for your clothes, your pearls and jewels,
or your golden crown, but if you will love me and let me be your companion
and playfellow, and sit by you at your little table, and eat off your
little golden plate, and drink out of your little cup, and sleep in your
little bed—if you will promise me this, I will go down below, and bring
your golden ball up again.”

“Oh, yes,” said she, “I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring my
ball back again.” She, however, thought, “How the silly Frog does talk! He
lives in the water with the other frogs and croaks, and can be no companion
to any human being!”

What did the frog offer to retrive for the princess?
