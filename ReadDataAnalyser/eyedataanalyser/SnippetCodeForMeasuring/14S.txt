There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little
cottage. They earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand to
mouth.

But it came to pass one day, when the man was sitting by the waterside and
casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold.

As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak and
said, “Hark you, Fisherman, if you will throw me back again into the water,
I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.”

Then the fisherman answered, “Of what use is a castle to me, if I have
nothing to eat?”

The Gold Fish continued, “That shall be taken care of. There will be a
cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of the
most delicate meats, and as many of them as you may desire.”

“If that be true,” said the man, “then I can well do you a favor.”

“Yes,” said the Fish, “there is, however, the condition that you shall tell
no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck has come.
If you speak but one single word, all will be over.”

What was the fish made entirely out of?
