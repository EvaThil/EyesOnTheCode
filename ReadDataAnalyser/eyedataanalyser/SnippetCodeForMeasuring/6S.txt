The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and
would have gone on forever, as long as his legs would carry him, though he
had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he
came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep.

But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a Golden Apple fell into his
hand. At the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves
upon his knee, and said, “We are the three young ravens whom you saved from
starving. When we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden
Apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life
stands, and have brought you the apple.”

The youth, full of joy, set out homeward, and took the Golden Apple to the
King’s beautiful Daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make. They
cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became
full of love for him, and they lived to a great age in undisturbed
happiness.

How many ravens flew down to him?
