When it was midday, they saw a beautiful Snow-White Bird sitting on a
bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it.
And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before
them. They followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted.

When they came quite up to the little House they saw that it was built of
bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.

“We will set to work on that,” said Haensel, “and have a good meal. I will
eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grethel, can eat some of the window; it
will taste sweet.”

Haensel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted.
Grethel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft
voice cried from the room:
“Nibble, nibble, gnaw! Who nibbles at my door?”

What were the windows made out of?
