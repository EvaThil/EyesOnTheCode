Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone. So there
sat the poor miller’s daughter, and for her life could not tell what to do.
She had no idea how straw could be spun into gold; and she grew more and
more miserable, until at last she began to weep.

But all at once the door opened, and in came a Little Man, and said, “Good
evening, Mistress Miller. Why are you crying so?”

“Alas!” answered the girl, “I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not
know how to do it.”

“What will you give me,” said the Little Man, “if I do it for you?”

“My necklace,” said the girl.

The Little Man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel, and
whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was full. Then he put
another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the second was
full too. And so it went on till the morning, when all the straw was spun,
and all the reels were full of gold.

What did the Little man turn the straw into?
